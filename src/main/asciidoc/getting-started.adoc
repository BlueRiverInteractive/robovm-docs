== Getting Started

In this section you'll learn how to install RoboVM and make sure the toolchain
works correctly by creating a very simple demo app.

TIP: Wanna run RoboVM on Linux? You can build Linux console apps using RoboVM
at this time. Please see the
https://github.com/robovm/robovm/wiki/Get-started-on-Linux[RoboVM GitHub wiki]
for instructions.

=== Prerequisites

In order to use RoboVM the following is required:

* A Mac running Mac OS X {osxversion} or later
* http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[Oracle's
  Java SE JDK 7]
* https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12[Xcode {xcodeversion} from the
  Mac App Store]

IMPORTANT: Eclipse *MUST* be run using Oracle’s Java SE 7 JDK or later. Apple’s
Java 6 JVM will not work. Running Eclipse itself in Java 7 is not the same as
adding a Java 7 JRE to Eclipe's _Installed JREs_ dialog in _Preferences_. To
check which Java version Eclipse is running in go to _Eclipse -> About
Eclipse_, then click _Installation Details_ and open the _Configuration_ tab.
Find the `java.version` property and make sure it is 1.7 or higher.

IMPORTANT: The default max heap setting for Eclipse may be too low. In order
to increase it *you need to change the -Xmx setting used when launching
Eclipse*. To do this locate your Eclipse installation folder, right-click the
Eclipse file and select Show Package Contents. Open the `eclipse.ini` file
located in `Contents/MacOS` in a text editor and change the -Xmx value to 2G
or more. Restart Eclipse.

NOTE: The first time you install Xcode and every time you update to a new
version you have to open it once to agree to the Xcode terms.

=== RoboVM for Eclipse Plugin Installation

Once your system meets all the requirements you install the plugin by
selecting _Install New Software_ from the Eclipse _Help_ menu, enter the
following update site into the _Work with_ field and click _Next_:

----
http://download.robovm.org/eclipse/
----

[[img-eclipse-install-new-software]]
.Eclipse _Install New Software_ dialog
image::eclipse-install-new-software.png[]

NOTE: The RoboVM for Eclipse plugin is known to work with Eclipse 4.3 (Kepler)
and later. We recommend you use Eclipse version 4.4 (Luna) or later.

[id="install-cli-tools"]
=== Command Line Tools Installation

To install the RoboVM command line tools just
http://download.robovm.org/robovm-{appversion}.tar.gz[download the latest
package], extract it and add the `robovm-{appversion}/bin/` folder to your
`$PATH` environment variable and set the `$ROBOVM_HOME` environment variable:

[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
$ curl -O 'http://download.robovm.org/robovm-{appversion}.tar.gz'
$ tar xvfz robovm-{appversion}.tar.gz
$ export ROBOVM_HOME=$(cd robovm-{appversion} ; pwd -P)
$ echo 'export ROBOVM_HOME="'"$ROBOVM_HOME"'"' >> ~/.profile
$ echo 'export PATH="$PATH:'$ROBOVM_HOME'/bin"' >> ~/.profile
----

If everything is working correctly you should see the command line usage help
text when you run
----
$ robovm -help
----

NOTE: If you change your `~/.profile` file you have to restart your shell or
open a new window or tab in Terminal for the changes to take effect.

[id=demo-app]
=== Your First iOS App

You should now be all set to run your first iOS app using RoboVM. In this section we will walk you through how to run a simple app <<iosdemo-eclipse>> and <<iosdemo-command-line>>.

[id="iosdemo-eclipse"]
==== In Eclipse

Create a new project using _File -> New -> Project..._ and select the _RoboVM
iOS Project_ wizard in the list.

[[img-ios-project-wizard]]
.The _RoboVM iOS Project wizard_
image::eclipse-ios-project-wizard.png[]

Enter `IOSDemo` as _Project name_, _App name_ and _Main class_. Enter
`org.robovm.IOSDemo` as _App id_. Click _Finish_.

[[img-create-project]]
.The _New RoboVM iOS Project_ dialog
image::eclipse-create-project.png[]

Now let's create that main class we specified in the new project dialog.
Create a new class and call it `IOSDemo` with no package name. Copy and paste
the code below into the newly created file replacing whatever Eclipse auto
generated for you.

[source,java]
----
include::IOSDemo.java[]
----

Finally, launch the app in the iOS simulator by right clicking the project you
created and select _Run As... -> iOS Simulator App (iPhone)_. This will run the
app on a simulated iPhone.

NOTE: To run the app on an actual device you would use the _Run As... -> iOS
Device App_ choice instead. Please note that this requires that the device has
been set up for development. Please refer to
https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/LaunchingYourApponDevices/LaunchingYourApponDevices.html[Apple's
documentation] for further information.

Check out the <<where-to-go-next>> section for pointers on where to go next.

[id="iosdemo-command-line"]
==== From the Command Line

We'll start off by creating a few directories:

[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
$ mkdir IOSDemo
$ cd IOSDemo/
$ mkdir src bin
----

Next create a new file called `IOSDemo.java` in the `src/` directory with the following contents:

[source,java]
----
include::IOSDemo.java[]
----

Compile `IOSDemo.java` using `javac`:

[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
$ javac -cp "$ROBOVM_HOME/lib/robovm-rt.jar:$ROBOVM_HOME/lib/robovm-objc.jar:$ROBOVM_HOME/lib/robovm-cocoatouch.jar" -d bin/ src/IOSDemo.java
----

Compile the Java bytecode into native code and launch the app using:

[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
$ robovm -verbose -arch x86 -os ios -cp "$ROBOVM_HOME/lib/robovm-objc.jar:$ROBOVM_HOME/lib/robovm-cocoatouch.jar:bin/" -run IOSDemo
----

[id="where-to-go-next"]
=== Where to go from here?

* Check out the <<the-robovm-for-eclipse-plugin>> section.
* If you'd rather use the command line you should check out the <<command-line-usage>> section.
* For more example projects have a look at the
