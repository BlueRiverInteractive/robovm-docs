== Configuration Reference

The recommended way to build RoboVM apps is to use a `robovm.xml` file to
configure the compiler. This section lists the supported elements and also the
corresponding command line options (if any).

The `robovm.xml` file is usually accompanied by a `robovm.properties` file.
The `robovm.xml` file will be searched for these properties and any matches
will be replaced with the actual value from the properties file. Properties
are referenced using the same `${...}` syntax as used by Maven, Gradle and
Ant. Here's and example:

.robovm.properties
[source]
app.executable=IOSDemo
app.name=IOSDemo

.robovm.xml
[source,xml]
<config>
  <executableName>${app.executable}</executableName>
  <mainClass>${app.mainclass}</mainClass>
  <os>ios</os>
  <arch>thumbv7</arch>
  <resources>
    <resource>
      <directory>resources</directory>
    </resource>
  </resources>
  <target>ios</target>
  <iosInfoPList>Info.plist.xml</iosInfoPList>
</config>

NOTE: All relative paths specified in a `robovm.xml` file will be resolved
relative to the file itself.

=== <installDir>

Specifies where to install the generated executable and other files. The
default is `<working-dir>/<executableName>`. For iOS apps the app will always
be created in a sub-folder in the specified `<installDir>` folder named like
the `CFBundleExecutable` value in the appÂ´s `Info.plist.xml` file and with
`.app` appended.

.Example:
[source,xml]
<installDir>target/MyApp</installDir>

.Command line usage:
`-d <dir>`

=== <executableName>

Specifies the name of the executable to be generated.

.Example:
[source,xml]
<executableName>MyAppExe</executableName>

.Command line usage:
-o <name>

=== <useDynamicJni>

Specifies whether to use dynamic JNI. With this enabled native methods will be
dynamically linked at runtime. Native methods in classes in the boot classpath
will always use static JNI. On iOS only static JNI is supported and this
option is ignored. The default is `false`.

.Example:
[source,xml]
<useDynamicJni>true</useDynamicJni>

.Command line usage:
`-dynamic-jni`

=== <skipRuntimeLib>

Specifies whether the default `robovm-rt.jar` should be automatically added to the bootclasspath. The default is `true`

.Example:
[source,xml]
<skipRuntimeLib>false</skipRuntimeLib>

.Command line usage:
`-skiprt`

=== <mainJar>

This is the equivalent of the `-jar` command line option to the `java`
command. The jar file will be added to the classpath and RoboVM will use the
`Main-Class` set in the `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` file in the jar file as
`<mainClass>` value. Either this or `<mainClass>` must be specified.

.Example:
[source,xml]
<mainJar>lib/my-app.jar</mainJar>

.Command line usage:
`-jar <file>`

=== <mainClass>

Specifies the fully-qualified name of the class containing the
`main(String[])` method that will be called when starting the app.  Either
this or `<mainJar>` must be specified.

.Example:
[source,xml]
<mainClass>com.example.MyApp</mainClass>

.Command line usage:
Specified after all RoboVM compiler options but before any program options.

=== <cacerts>

Specifies the cacerts file to be included in the app. RoboVM includes the same
CA cerificates as included in Android 4.4.3. Allowed values are `none` and
`full`. Default is `full` but no cacerts will be included unless the code
actually needs them.

.Example:
[source,xml]
<cacerts>none</cacerts>

.Command line usage:
`-cacerts <value>`

=== <os>

Specifies the name of the OS to build for. Allowed values are `auto`, `linux`,
`macosx` and `ios`. Default is `auto` which normally means to build for the
current host OS.

.Example:
[source,xml]
<os>ios</os>

.Command line usage:
`-os <name>`

=== <arch>

Specifies the name of the CPU architecture to compile for. Allowed values are
`auto`, `x86`, `x86_64`, `thumbv7`, `arm64`. Default is `auto` which  normally
means to build for the current host's CPU architecture.

.Example:
[source,xml]
<arch>thumbv7</arch>

.Command line usage:
`-arch <name>`

=== <forceLinkClasses>

Contains `<pattern>` elements listing class patterns matching classes that
must be linked in even if not referenced (directly or indirectly) from the
main class. If no main class is specified all classes will be linked in unless
this option has been given. Patterns are specified using an ANT style path
syntax with the following rules:

* `?` matches one character.
* `*` matches zero or more characters.
* `**` matches zero or more packages in a fully-qualified class name.

An alternative syntax using `#` is also supported. This is useful when
specifying patterns on the command line as it prevents the shall from
expanding `*` characters.

.Example:
[source,xml]
<forceLinkClasses>
  <pattern>com.android.okhttp.HttpHandler</pattern>
  <pattern>com.android.okhttp.HttpsHandler</pattern>
  <pattern>com.android.org.conscrypt.**</pattern>
</forceLinkClasses>

.Command line usage:
`-forcelinkclasses <list>`

NOTE: `-forcelinkclasses` can either be specified multiple times on the
command line, each specifying a single pattern or specified once with multiple
`:` separated patterns. E.g. `-forcelinkclasses
'com.example.Foo:com.example.bar.**'`.

=== <libs>

Specifies, in nested `<lib>` elements, static libraries (with extension `.a`),
object files (with extension `.o`) and system libraries that should be
included when linking the final executable.

If `force="true"` has been specified for a `<lib>` poining at a static library
the entire static library will be linked in regardless of whether the symbols
in it are referenced by the rest of the app's code or not. This uses the
`-force_load` command line linker option when building for Mac OS X and iOS
and `--whole-archive` when building for Linux. The default is `force="true"`.

.Example:
[source,xml]
<libs>
  <lib force="false">lib/libfoo.a</lib>
  <lib>lib/myobjectfile.o</lib>
  <lib>curl</lib>
</libs>

.Command line usage:
`-libs <list>`

NOTE: `-libs` can either be specified multiple times on the command line, each
specifying a single value or specified once with multiple `:` separated
values. E.g. `-libs 'lib/libfoo.a:curl'`.

CAUTION: There's no way to specify `force="false"` when using `-libs` from the
command line. Use a `robovm.xml` file instead.

=== <exportedSymbols>

Specifies, in nested `<symbol>` elements, symbols that should be exported when
linking the executable. This can be used when linking in functions which will
be called using <<bro,Bro>>. Wildcards can be used to match symbols:

* `*` matches zero or more characters,
* `?` matches one character.
* `[abc]`, `[a-z]` matches one character from the specified set of characters.

.Example:
[source,xml]
<exportedSymbols>
  <symbol>CB*</symbol>
  <symbol>sin</symbol>
</exportedSymbols>

.Command line usage:
`-exportedsymbols <list>`

NOTE: `-exportedsymbols` can either be specified multiple times on the command line, each
specifying a single value or specified once with multiple `:` separated
values. E.g. `-exportedsymbols 'CB*:sin'`.

=== <frameworks>

Specifies, in nested `<framework>` elements, Mac OS X or iOS frameworks that
should be linked against when linking the final executable.

.Example:
[source,xml]
<frameworks>
  <framework>CoreImage</framework>
  <framework>UIKit</framework>
</frameworks>

.Command line usage:
`-frameworks <list>`

NOTE: `-frameworks` can either be specified multiple times on the command
line, each specifying a single value or specified once with multiple `:`
separated values. E.g. `-frameworks 'CoreImage:UIKit'`.

=== <weakFrameworks>

Specifies, in nested `<framework>` elements, Mac OS X or iOS frameworks that
should be weakly linked against when linking the final executable. Weakly
linking against a framework means that all symbols in the framework will be
marked as weakly linked. This allows apps to be built against one version of a
framework which defines a particular symbol and later run against a different
version of that framework which doesn't have that symbol defined. If that
symbol had been strongly linked the app would immediately crash at launch.

.Example:
[source,xml]
<weakFrameworks>
  <framework>AdSupport</framework>
  <framework>StoreKit</framework>
</weakFrameworks>

.Command line usage:
`-weakframeworks <list>`

NOTE: `-weakframeworks` can either be specified multiple times on the command
line, each specifying a single value or specified once with multiple `:`
separated values. E.g. `-weakframeworks 'CoreImage:UIKit'`.

=== <frameworkPaths>

Specifies, in nested `<path>` elements, framework search paths used when
searching for custom frameworks.

.Example:
[source,xml]
<frameworkPaths>
  <path>lib/frameworks</path>
</frameworkPaths>

.Command line usage:
`-frameworkpaths <list>`

NOTE: `-frameworkpaths` can either be specified multiple times on the command
line, each specifying a single value or specified once with multiple `:`
separated values. E.g. `-frameworkpaths 'lib/frameworks:../frameworks'`.

=== <resources>

Specifies files and directories that should be copied to the installation
directory. A resource can be specified using a single path:

.Example:
[source,xml]
<resources>
  <resource>path/to/the/resource.txt</resource>
</resources>

NOTE: If the path specifies a directory, that directory including its contents
(except for the default excludes, see below) will be copied. If the path
specifies a file, that file will be copied directly to the installation directory.

A resource be also be specified with a base directory, a target path and include and exclude
filters (similar to Maven's `<resource>` element):

.Example:
[source,xml]
<resources>
  <resource>
   <targetPath>data</targetPath>
   <directory>resources</directory>
   <includes>
     <include>**/*</include>
   </includes>
   <excludes>
     <exclude>**/*.bak</exclude>
   </excludes>
   <flatten>false</flatten>
   <ignoreDefaultExcludes>false</ignoreDefaultExcludes>
   <skipPngCrush>false</skipPngCrush>
  </resource>
</resources>

==== <targetPath>

The target path relative to the installation directory (i.e. app bundle
directory for iOS apps) where paths matching this `<resource>` will be copied.
If not specified paths will be copied directly to the installation directory.

==== <directory>

The base directory containing the files and directories copied by the
`<resource>`.

==== <includes>

Specifies one or more Ant-style patterns (using `**`, `*` and `?` as
wildcards) matching files which will be included when copying this
`<resource>`.

==== <excludes>

Specifies one or more Ant-style patterns (using `**`, `*` and `?` as
wildcards) matching files which will be excluded when copying this
`<resource>`.

==== <flatten>

Set to `true` if the files matched by this `<resource>` should be copied
directly into the installation directory without preserving the directory
structure of the source directory. The default is `false`.

==== <ignoreDefaultExcludes>

Set to `true` if the <<defaultexcludes,default excludes>> should be ignored
and copied for this `<resource>`. The default is `false`, i.e. don't copy
files matching the default excludes.

==== <skipPngCrush>

Set this to `true` if `pngcrush` should not be called for PNG files matching
this `<resource>` when targeting iOS. The default is `false`,
i.e. `pngcrush` WILL be called for PNG files.

NOTE: Depending on the target (iOS, Mac OS X or Linux) resources may be
transformed and renamed while being copied (e.g. running `pngcrush` or
converting `xib` files to `nib` files).

[id="resourceprocessing"]
==== Resource processing

By default, any resources found in the specified resource paths will be copied
to the installation directory. However, there exist several specific files and folders
that need to be processed first before they can be used in an iOS application. +
The following sections explain which resources will be automatically processed
for you and what they are used for.

===== .xcassets folders

`.xcassets` folders, also known as `Asset Catalogs`, contain graphical assets grouped
into several subfolders, also known as `Sets`. Each set contains several image files along with a `Contents.json`
file that describes the images. +
The following types of sets are supported:

<name>.imageset:: If your app has a deployment target of iOS 7 or higher images
in this set will be converted into a runtime binary format to reduce the overall
app size. Otherwise they will simply be copied to the install directory. +
You can access an image by its name with `UIImage.create(String)`.
AppIcon.appiconset:: Images in this set will be used as the app icon of the iOS app.
LaunchImage.launchimage:: Images in this set will be used as the launch image
of the iOS app.

===== .atlas folders

`.atlas` folders contain several graphic files that will be merged into one or
multiple texture atlases. The result is a `.atlasc` folder named after the resource
folder that contains the texture atlas image files and a property list file with the
coordinates to all texture regions. +
The resulting texture atlas can be used via SpriteKit's `SKTextureAtlas` or
manually by reading the files.

NOTE: Texture atlas generation can be configured with the <<tools>> element.

[id="defaultexcludes"]
==== Default excludes

(The same as those used by Ant 1.9)

.Command line usage:
`-resources <list>`

NOTE: `-resources` can either be specified multiple times on the command line, each
specifying a single value or specified once with multiple `:` separated
values. E.g. `-resources '+resources/**:data/*+'`.

CAUTION: If a pattern is specified on the command line using `-resources` the
longest non-pattern path before the first wildcard will be used as base
directory and will not be recreated in the installation directory. E.g. with
the pattern `+resources/**+` all files and folders in the folder named
`resources` will be copied directly to the installation directory.

[id="tools"]
=== <tools>

Specifies, in nested elements, additional configuration options for various command
line tools that are used to process Cocoa-specific resources.
For a list of resource types that get processed see <<resourceprocessing>>.

==== <textureAtlas>

Specifies configuration options for the `TextureAtlas` tool.
This tool is used for processing `.atlas` folders with image files into valid
texture atlases.

.Example:
[source,xml]
<tools>
  <textureAtlas>
    <outputFormat>RGBA8888_PNG</outputFormat>
    <maximumTextureDimension>2048x2048</maximumTextureDimension>
    <powerOfTwo>true</powerOfTwo>
  </textureAtlas>
</tools>

===== <outputFormat>

Specifies the output format of the resulting texture atlas. +
Can be any of the following:

* RGBA8888_PNG (default)
* RGBA8888_COMPRESSED
* RGBA4444_COMPRESSED
* RGBA5551_COMPRESSED
* RGB565_COMPRESSED

===== <maximumTextureDimension>

Specifies the maximum allowed dimension of the resulting texture atlas. +
Can be any of the following:

* 2048x2048 (default)
* 4096x4096

===== <powerOfTwo>

Specifies whether the dimensions of the resulting texture atlas should be power
of 2. Default is `false`.

=== <bootclasspath>

Specifies, in nested `<classpathentry>` elements, directories, JAR archives,
and ZIP archives to search for class files to be compiled by the RoboVM
compiler. Classes in these entries will be loaded by the boot classloader at
runtime.  Used to locate the `+java.*+` and `+javax.*+` classes. Default is
`<robovm-home>/lib/robovm-rt.jar`.

.Example:
[source,xml]
<bootclasspath>
  <classpathentry>path/to/my/robovm-rt.jar</classpathentry>
</bootclasspath>

.Command line usage:
`-bootclasspath <list>`
`-bootcp <list>`
`-bcp <list>`

NOTE: `-bootclasspath` can either be specified multiple times on the command
line, each specifying a single value or specified once with multiple `:`
separated values.

CAUTION: When running RoboVM in an IDE like Eclipse or from a build tool such
as Maven or Gradle the `<bootclasspath>` and `<classpath>` elements in the
`robovm.xml` file will be ignored. Instead the classpaths of the IDE or build
tool with be used.

=== <classpath>

Specifies, in nested `<classpathentry>` elements, directories, JAR archives,
and ZIP archives to search for class files to be compiled by the RoboVM
compiler. Classes in these entries will be loaded by the system classloader at
runtime.

.Example:
[source,xml]
<classpath>
  <classpathentry>target/classes</classpathentry>
  <classpathentry>lib/commons-lang.jar</classpathentry>
</classpath>

.Command line usage:
`-classpath <list>`
`-cp <list>`

NOTE: `-classpath` can either be specified multiple times on the command line,
each specifying a single value or specified once with multiple `:` separated
values.

CAUTION: When running RoboVM in an IDE like Eclipse or from a build tool such
as Maven or Gradle the `<bootclasspath>` and `<classpath>` elements in the
`robovm.xml` file will be ignored. Instead the classpaths of the IDE or build
tool with be used.

////
=== <pluginArguments>
////

=== <targetType>

Specifies the target to build for. Either `auto`, `console` or `ios`. The default is
`auto` which means use `<os>` to decide.

.Example:
[source,xml]
<targetType>ios</targetType>

.Command line usage:
`-target <name>`

=== <iosSdkVersion>

(*iOS only*) Specifies the version number of the iOS SDK to build against. If not specified
the latest SDK that can be found will be used.

.Example:
[source,xml]
<iosSdkVersion>8.0</iosSdkVersion>

.Command line usage:
`-sdk <version>`

=== <iosInfoPList>

(*iOS only*) `Info.plist` file to be used by the app. If not specified a
simple `Info.plist` will be generated with a `CFBundleIdentifier` based on the
`<mainClass>` or `<executableName>`.

.Example:
[source,xml]
<iosInfoPList>plists/Info.plist</iosInfoPList>

.Command line usage:
`-plist <file>`

TIP: The specified `Info.plist` file will be searched for `${...}` patterns
just like `robovm.xml` files are. Such patterns will be replaced by the
corresponding property, usually read from a `robovm.properties` file.

=== <iosResourceRulesPList>

(*iOS only*) Property list (`.plist`) file containing resource rules passed to
`codesign` when signing the app.

.Example:
[source,xml]
<iosResourceRulesPList>plists/ResourceRules.plist</iosResourceRulesPList>

.Command line usage:
`-resourcerules <file>`

=== <iosEntitlementsPList>

(*iOS only*) Property list (`.plist`) file containing entitlements passed to
`codesign` when signing the app.

.Example:
[source,xml]
<iosEntitlementsPList>plists/Entitlements.plist</iosEntitlementsPList>

.Command line usage:
`-entitlements <file>`

[id="command-line-usage"]
== Command Line Usage

This section describes how to carry out some of the most common actions using
the `robovm` command line tool. For a complete usage reference for the options
supported by the `robovm` tool run

[source,bash]
----
$ robovm -help
----

=== Working with robovm.xml files

Almost everything can be done directly from the command line using the
options of the `robovm` command but it is still recommended to use an
<<config-reference,XML configuration file>> called `robovm.xml` to configure
the compiler.

The `-dumpconfig` option can be used to create a `robovm.xml` file. This
creates a `robovm.xml` file for the demo app in <<demo-app>>:

[source,bash]
----
$ robovm -arch thumbv7 -os ios -cp "$ROBOVM_HOME/lib/robovm-objc.jar:$ROBOVM_HOME/lib/robovm-cocoatouch.jar:bin/" -dumpconfig robovm.xml IOSDemo
----

Once we have the `robovm.xml` file we only have to specify it on the command
line to launch the app. This would launch the app on a connected device since
the `robovm.xml` file specifies the `thumbv7` architecture:

[source,bash]
----
$ robovm -config robovm.xml -run
----

TIP: You can load multiple configurations by specifying `-config` multiple
times. The latter ones take precedence.

We can override the configuration read from a `robovm.xml` file by specifying the options we want to override after the `robovm.xml` file has been read in. To launch on the iOS simulator we need to build for the `x86` architecture so we use the `-arch` option *after* the configuration file has been specified:

[source,bash]
----
$ robovm -config robovm.xml -arch x86 -run
----

We can even "edit" the `robovm.xml` file by combining `-config` and `-dumpconfig`. This adds a new classpath entry:

[source,bash]
----
$ robovm -config robovm.xml -cp foo.jar -dumpconfig robovm-new.xml
$ mv robovm-new.xml robovm.xml
----

=== Expanding properties in robovm.xml files

XML configuration files (and also `Info.plist` files) will be searched for `${...}` patterns. Such patterns will be replaced with properties loaded using the `-properties` command line option which reads in `.properties` file. Individual properties can also be specified directly on the command line using the `-Pname=value` option.

=== Launching apps

To launch an app using the command line tool you simply specify the `-run`
command line option. RoboVM will use the configured target OS (`-os`) and
architecture (`-arch`) to determine how to launch the app.

To launch in the iOS simulator use `-os ios` `-arch x86`:

[source,bash]
----
$ robovm -cp ... -os ios -arch x86 -run com.example.MainClass
----

To launch on an iOS device in 32-bit mode use `-os ios` `-arch thumbv7`:

[source,bash]
----
$ robovm -cp ... -os ios -arch thumbv7 -run com.example.MainClass
----

To launch on an iOS device in 64-bit mode use `-os ios` `-arch arm64`:

[source,bash]
----
$ robovm -cp ... -os ios -arch arm64 -run com.example.MainClass
----

RoboVM also supports building Mac OS X console apps. This is what you get if
you don't specify any `-os` or `-arch` (or use `-os macosx` `-arch x86`):

[source,bash]
----
$ robovm -cp ... -run com.example.MainClass
----

=== Packaging for App Store/Ad-Hoc distribution

The `-createipa` option is used to create an
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.ipa_(file_extension)[IPA file] which can be
submitted to the App Store or distributed to beta tester or throughout an
enterprise.

NOTE: Before you can do this you will have to have your signing certificates
and provisioning profiles in order. Apple has some
https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012582-CH1-SW1[great
resources] that describe how to enroll in the iOS developers program and
create the certificates and provisioning profiles required for App Store
distribution.


This will create an IPA file signed with the code signing certificate matching
_iPhone Distribution_ and using the provisioning profile named __My
Distribution Profile__. The IPA will be stored in `~/Desktop/IPA/`:

[source,bash]
----
$ robovm -config robovm.xml -signidentity 'iPhone Distribution' -provisioningprofile 'My Distribution Profile' -d ~/Desktop/IPA/ -createipa
----

TIP: The `-signingidentiy` option matches against the start of the certificate
name. Alternatively you can use a certificate fingerprint. If the
`-signingidentiy` value is enclosed in `/` a regexp search will be done
against the certificate name instead. Run the command `security find-identity
-v -p codesigning` or use the _KeyChain Access_ OS X app to view your
installed certificates.

CAUTION: The IPA creation also creates a `.dSYM` folder in the folder you
specify with `-d`. The `.dSYM` contains the debug symbols of your app. It is
required if you want to symbolicate a crash report generated by your app. To
symbolicate you need the exact `.dSYM` so *make sure you back this up*.

The IPA is now ready to be distributed. To submit the IPA file to the App
Store you would use the _Application Loader_ application that comes with
Xcode. The _Application Loader_ application can easily be located using
_Spotlight_.
